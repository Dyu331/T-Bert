This project is a revamped version of the classic arcade game Q-Bert. This project by my group of 4 during the 2022 CMU NHSGA summer program. 

This revamp kept the original gameplay of the game and opted to redesign the character to fit the  Jurassic Theme, with the main character being a t-rex (T-Bert). 

I don't currently have the unity file of this game, but the content in the "T-Bert Build" folder does offer the complete gameplay.
